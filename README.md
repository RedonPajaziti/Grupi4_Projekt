Interactive Digital Clock – C++ Group Project

-Overview-- <br>
This project is an interactive digital clock simulation developed in C++ as a group assignment.<br>
The program allows the user to set an initial time and then interactively add seconds, minutes, or hours using simple keyboard commands. The time is automatically adjusted to remain valid within a 24-hour format. <br>
This project focuses on: <br>
  Structured programming using struct <br>
  Member functions in C++ <br>
  User input handling <br>
  Time incrementation logic <br>
  Console-based interaction <br>
  <br>
-How the Program Works-- <br>
The user enters the initial time. <br>
The program displays available commands: <br>
  S / s → add one second <br>
  M / m → add one minute <br>
  O / o → add one hour <br>
  X / x → exit and show final time <br>
The user can apply multiple operations as shown in the image below. <br>
